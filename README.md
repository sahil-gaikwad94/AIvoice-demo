# Voice AI Demo

This is a simple, self-contained web application that demonstrates a voice-to-voice interaction with Google's Gemini AI. The conversation is then logged to an Airtable base for record-keeping. This project was built to be easily set up and deployed.

## Features

-   **Voice Input**: Uses the browser's Web Speech API to capture your voice.
-   **AI Response**: Sends the transcribed text to Google's Gemini Pro model to generate a conversational response.
-   **Voice Output**: Uses the Web Speech API to speak the AI's response back to you.
-   **Conversation Logging**: Logs the user's query and the AI's response to a designated Airtable base.
-   **Zero Dependencies**: Runs directly in the browser with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No installation or build process needed.
